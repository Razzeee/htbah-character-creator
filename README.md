# htbah-character-creator
This is a character creation step by step site. You can find the [How to be a hero rules in german here](https://howtobeahero.de/).
Some images are also from the [How to be a hero wiki](https://howtobeahero.de/). Thanks for being able to use them.

## Development

Start the hot-reloading webpack dev server:

    npm start

Navigate to <http://localhost:3000>.

Any changes you make to your files (.elm, .js, .css, etc.) will trigger
a hot reload.

## Production

Just push or create an PR and it will be updated by travis magic :)
